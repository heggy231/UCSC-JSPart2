    <title>The context referenced by 'this' keyword in JavasSript is different.</title>

<p>What it does is really simple. when you click the button, the button will be disabled automatically.
    First when you try to hook up the events in this way button.onclick = function(),
    onclick event will be triggered by clicking the button, however, the button will not be disabled
    because there's no explicit binding between button.onclick and onclick event handler.
    If you debug see the 'this' object, you can see it refers to 'window' object.
    Secondly, if you comment btnSubmit.onclick = disable();
    and uncomment //btnSubmit.addEventListener('click', disable, false);
    you can see that the button is disabled because with this way there's explicit binding
    between button.onclick event and onclick event handler.
    If you debug into disable function, you can see 'this' refers to the button control rather than the window.</p>
<input id="btnSubmit" type="button" value="Submit" />
<script>
    function disable() {
        this.disabled = true;
    }
    var btnSubmit = document.getElementById('btnSubmit');
    //btnSubmit.onclick = disable();
    btnSubmit.addEventListener('click', disable, false);
