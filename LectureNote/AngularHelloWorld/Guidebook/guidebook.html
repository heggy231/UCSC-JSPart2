<!--
Some of this looks familiar. We have our DocType, we're including AngularJS, and we have a couple of annotations.
We're also including all of our model and controller files, but none of our view files (views are mapped via JavaScript,
which we'll get to in a minute).

Note that this time, we're defining a name for our application in the ng-app annotation.
This isn't necessary, as we saw in our last example, but it's a good idea for real-world applications,
because it helps us to namespace our models and controllers.
(If we had two AngularJS applications on the same page, separate modules would help us remember which components belong to which application).

We also have a new annotation: ng-view. This tells AngularJS where to load our views.
There can only be one instance of ng-view, and it should contain everything we want to load and change dynamically in the application.
If something resides outside of ng-view, like the heading in our earlier example, it will be visible at all times.-->
