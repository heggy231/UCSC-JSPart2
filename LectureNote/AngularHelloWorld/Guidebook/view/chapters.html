This is quite a bit more complicated than our Hello World view!
I know there's a lot of AngularJS magic there, which may seem a little daunting.
Let's just focus on the controller interaction for the time being, and we'll fill in the syntax gap later.

Let's start by thinking about what we're trying to do.
We want to show all of the chapters of this book, and for the selected chapter, we also want to show any notes the user has created.
Furthermore, each chapter needs an add note link, and each note needs a delete me link. Let's look at how our implementation works.

We begin with a list item with the ng-repeat annotation.
Think of this as a ForEach loop in JavaScript.
It's expecting a list of chapters in our $scope, and hopefully each chapter has a title and a summary,
because we're showing those on the next two lines.

After that we show a couple of HTML links (with a little AngularJS enhancement, as usual).
Remember how our routes are set up: the first link will reload ChaptersController
with chapterId of the current chapter (we're in a loop, so we'll make one of these links for each chapter).
The second, about five lines later, will take us to AddNoteController with the addNote template, which we'll look at in a moment.

After that, we have another ng-repeat for the notes of the current chapter.
We're using an ng-show annotation (like an if conditional) to only show the notes
if the current chapterId in our outer loop matches $scope.selectedChapterId,
and if we are showing notes, we'll print the ID and content of each one,
and add a link that will call $scope.onDelete() when clicked.

Again, don't worry about mastering the syntax just yet.
Instead, focus on how the view gets information from the controller. We expect all of the following:

A list of chapters, each containing a title, summary, and a list of notes. All notes should have an ID and a content property.
A property called selectedChapterId.
A function called onDelete().


Next, we set selectedChapterId to whatever chapterId we picked up in our URL.
If there was no chapterId in the URL, this will be undefined, which is fineâ€”we used selectedChapterId in the view to show notes if a chapter was selected.
If there's no selection, we simply won't display any notes.

Finally, we're giving the view an onDelete() function to run if the user clicks on the delete note link we saw earlier.
This function uses the window.confirm() method built into JavaScript (remember, AngularJS is an enhancement;
we still have access to standard JavaScript features in our controller).
If the user proceeds with the deletion, we use the $location parameter to change our URL and load DeleteNoteController.
