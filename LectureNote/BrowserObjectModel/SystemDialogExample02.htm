    <!--To determine if the user clicked OK or Cancel, the confirm() method-->
    <!--returns a Boolean value: true if OK was clicked, or false if Cancel-->
    <!--was clicked or the dialog box was closed by clicking the X in the-->
    <!--corner.-->

    <!--In this example, the confi rm dialog is displayed to the user in the fi rst line,-->
    <!--which is a condition of the if statement.-->
    <!--If the user clicks OK, an alert is displayed saying, “I’m so glad you’re sure!”-->
    <!--If, however, the Cancel button is clicked, an alert is displayed saying, “I’m sorry to hear you’re-->
    <!--not sure.” This type of pattern is often employed when the user tries to delete something, such as-->
    <!--an e-mail message.-->
