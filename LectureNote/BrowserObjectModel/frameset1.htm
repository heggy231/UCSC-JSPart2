<!--When the first frameset is loaded into the browser, it loads another frameset into rightFrame.-->
<!--If code is written inside redFrame (or blueFrame), the parent object points to rightFrame. If,-->
<!--however, the code is written in topFrame, then parent points to top because its immediate parent is-->
<!--the outermost frame.-->

<!--Note that the topmost window will never have a value set for name unless the window was opened-->
<!--using window.open(), as discussed later in this chapter.-->
<!--There is one final window object, called self, which always points to window. The two can, in fact,-->
<!--be used interchangeably. Even though it has no separate value, self is included for consistency with-->
<!--the top and parent objects.-->
<!--Each of these objects is actually a proper™ty of the window object, accessible via window.parent,-->
<!--window.top, and so on. This means it’s possible to chain window objects together, such as window-->
<!--.parent.parent.frames[0].-->
