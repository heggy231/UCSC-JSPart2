    <!--The splice() method always returns an array that contains any items that were removed from-->
    <!--the array (or an empty array if no items were removed). -->
    <!--This example begins with the colors array containing three items. When splice is called the fi rst-->
    <!--time, it simply removes the fi rst item, leaving colors with the items “green” and “blue”. The-->
    <!--second time splice() is called, it inserts two items at position 1, resulting in colors containing-->
    <!--“green”, “yellow”, “orange”, and “blue”. No items are removed at this point, so an empty array-->
    <!--is returned. The last time splice() is called, it removes one item, beginning in position 1, and-->
    <!--inserts “red” and “purple”. After all of this code has been executed, the colors array contains-->
    <!--“green”, “red”, “purple”, “orange”, and “blue”.-->
