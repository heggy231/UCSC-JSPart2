<!--In this code, the alert is displayed successfully. Even though the variable someUndeclaredVariable-->
<!--is undefined, it is never evaluated, because the first operand is false. This means that the result of-->
<!--the operation must be false, so there is no reason to evaluate whatâ€™s to the right of the &&. Always-->
<!--keep in mind short-circuiting when using logical AND.-->
