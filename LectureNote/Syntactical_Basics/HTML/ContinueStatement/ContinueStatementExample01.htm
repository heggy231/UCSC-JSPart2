//    Here, the alert displays 8, the number of times the loop has been executed. When i reaches a value
//    of 5, the loop is exited before num is incremented, but execution continues with the next iteration,
//    when the value is 6. The loop then continues until its natural completion, when i is 10. The
//    fi nal value of num is 8 instead of 9, because one increment didnâ€™t occur because of the continue
//    statement.
