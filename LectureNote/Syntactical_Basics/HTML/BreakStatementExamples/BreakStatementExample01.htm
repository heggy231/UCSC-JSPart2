//    In this code, the for loop increments the variable i from 1 to 10. In the body of loop, an if
//    statement checks to see if the value of i is evenly divisible by 5 (using the modulus operator).
    If so,
//    the break statement is executed and the loop is exited.
    The num variable starts out at 0 and indicates

//    the number of times the loop has been executed.
    After the break statement has been hit, the next
//    line of code to be executed is the alert, which displays 4.
    So the number of times the loop has been
//    executed is four because when i equals 5, the break statement causes the loop to
    be exited before
//    num can be incremented.
