    <!--Here, the function addTen() has an argument num, which is essentially a local variable. When called,-->
    <!--the variable count is passed in as an argument. This variable has a value of 20, which is copied-->
    <!--into the argument num for use inside of addTen(). Within the function, the argument num has its-->
    <!--value changed by adding 10, but this doesnâ€™t change the original variable count that exists outside-->
    <!--of the function. The argument num and the variable count do not recognize each other; they only-->
    <!--happen to have the same value. If num had been passed by reference, then the value of count would-->
    <!--have changed to 30 to reflect the change made inside the function.-->
