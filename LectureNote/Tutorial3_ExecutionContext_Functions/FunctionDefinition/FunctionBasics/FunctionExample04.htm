    <title>Function Example 4</title>

    <!--The return statement can also be used without specifying a return value. When used in this way,-->
    <!--the function stops executing immediately and returns undefined as its value. This is typically used-->
    <!--in functions that don’t return a value to stop function execution early, as in the following example,-->
    <!--where the alert won’t be displayed:-->

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function sayHi(name, message) {
            return;
            alert("Hello " + name + ", " + message);    //never called
        }

        sayHi("Nicholas", "how are you today?");
    </script>
