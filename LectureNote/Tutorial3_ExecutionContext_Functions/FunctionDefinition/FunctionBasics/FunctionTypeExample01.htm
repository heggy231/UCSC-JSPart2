    <!--This code defines a function named sum() that adds two numbers together.
     A variable, anotherSum,-->
    <!--is declared and set equal to sum. Note that using the function name
    without parentheses accesses the-->
    <!--function pointer instead of executing the function.
    At this point, both anotherSum and sum point-->
    <!--to the same function, meaning that anotherSum() can be called and a
     result returned. When sum-->
    <!--is set to null, it severs its relationship with the function,
    although anotherSum() can still be called-->
    <!--without any problems.-->
    <title>Function Type Example</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    
        var sum =  function(num1, num2){
            return num1 + num2;
        }        
        alert(sum(10,10));    //20
        
        var anotherSum = sum;        
        alert(anotherSum(10,10));  //20
        
        sum = null;        
        alert(anotherSum(10,10));  //20
