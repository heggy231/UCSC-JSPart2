    If we execute doSomething() without any more preparation the this keyword refers to the window and the
    function tries to change the style.color of the window.
    Since the window doesnot have a style object the function fails miserably and produces JavaScript errors.
    Copying :
        So if we want to use this to its full extent we have to take care that the function that uses it is "owned" by the correct HTML element.
        In other words, we have to copy the function to our onclick property:

        element.onclick = doSomething;

        The function is copied in its entirety to the onclick property (which now becomes a method).
        So if the event handler is executed this refers to the HTML element and its color is changed.

    Referring

    However, if you use inline event registration

    <!--<element onclick="doSomet

        you do not copy the function! Instead, you refer to it, and the difference is crucial.
        The onclick property does not contain the actual function, but merely a function call:

        doSomething();

        So it says “Go to doSomething() and execute it.” When we arrive at doSomething() the this keyword once again refers to the global window object and the function returns error messages.
